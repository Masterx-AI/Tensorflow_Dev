# Tensorflow Dev

TensorFlow is an open source framework developed by Google researchers to run machine learning, deep learning and other statistical and predictive analytics workloads. Like similar platforms, it's designed to streamline the process of developing and executing advanced analytics applications for users such as data scientists, statisticians and predictive modelers.

The TensorFlow software handles data sets that are arrayed as computational nodes in graph form. The edges that connect the nodes in a graph can represent multidimensional vectors or matrices, creating what are known as tensors. Because TensorFlow programs use a data flow architecture that works with generalized intermediate results of the computations, they are especially open to very large-scale parallel processing applications, with neural networks being a common example.

The framework includes sets of both high-level and low-level APIs. Google recommends using the high-level ones when possible to simplify data pipeline development and application programming. However, knowing how to use the low-level APIs -- called TensorFlow Core -- can be valuable for experimentation and debugging of applications, the company says; it also gives users a "mental model" of the machine learning technology's inner workings, in Google's words.

TensorFlow applications can run on either conventional CPUs or higher-performance graphics processing units (GPUs), as well as Google's own tensor processing units (TPUs), which are custom devices expressly designed to speed up TensorFlow jobs. Google's first TPUs, detailed publicly in 2016, were used internally in conjunction with TensorFlow to power some of the company's applications and online services, including its RankBrain search algorithm and Street View mapping technology.

In early 2018, Google furthered its external TensorFlow efforts by making the second generation of TPUs available to Google Cloud Platform users for training and running their own machine learning models. TensorFlow-based workloads are billed on a per-second basis; the Cloud TPU service initially was launched as a beta program with only "limited quantities" of the devices available for use, according to Google.


### **We shall try to understand custom development with Tensorflow:**
1. Custom Layers
2. Custom Model
3. Custom Training
